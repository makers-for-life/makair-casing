## üì¶ MakAir Cube Experimental Design

On the side, we are working on an experimental, fully 3D-printable casing. It has the benefit of being more user-friendly, as well as much more compact and practical to use and handle (eg. if the MakAir needs to be moved to another room). It also has a minimum cubic footprint: 20cm x 20cm x 20cm, and aims at being lightweight.

**‚û°Ô∏è You can [view it in 3D](https://a360.co/2RHpseW) in your Web browser.**

Multiple of those casings can be stacked on the top of each other, as well as on the sides of each other. This makes shipping of a large number of those ventilators much handier than with previous casing versions, by stacking them in a truck without any extra protections overhead.

The screen is set on the top, as to save casing space. The legacy 4 lines small display was removed from the front side, while the 7" color touchscreen handles all control tasks ‚Äî that came previously from hardware buttons.

This design makes mass-manufacturing more convenient, as components are split into 2 stages: pneumatics and electronics. Both stages are then inserted in the molded casing from the bottom, and screwed into place. Maintenance is also easier with this new design, as stages can be unscrewed and slided out of the casing. If a stage cannot be repaired onto place, it can be swapped with a replacement stage in a matter of minutes.

**Note: this design is not ready yet. We are currently testing it and making refinements.**
