## üöÄ Experimental Design

On the side, we are working on an experimental, fully 3D-printable casing. It has the benefit of being more user-friendly, as well as much more compact and practical to use and handle (eg. if the MakAir needs to be moved to another room).

**‚û°Ô∏è You can [view it in 3D](https://a360.co/2BoKPgj) in your Web browser.**

Multiple of those casings can be stacked on the top of each other, as well as on the sides of each other. This makes shipping of a large number of those ventilators much handier than with previous casing versions, by stacking them in a truck without any extra protections overhead.

The screen is tilted by 45 degrees so that, whichever the height of the table the MakAir lays on, the UI can still be reached. The legacy 4 lines small display was removed from the front side, and sits inside the ventilator unit for debugging purposes, while the 7" color touchscreen handles all control tasks ‚Äî that came previously from hardware buttons.
